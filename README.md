## R Notebooks
All these notebooks are still under active development as I learn stuff and come up with more ideas. It's more of a playground than a portfolio.

### [ACS Diversity](https://shalbrook.github.io/acs-diversity/)
Brief R script to calculate diversity of an MSA using the ACS API, tidycensus, and the Simpson's Diversity Index.

### [Language Maps for Austin Public Health](https://shalbrook.github.io/language-maps-for-aph/)
R code to retrieve language data by census tract for Travis County, Texas, using 2013-2017 5-year ACS estimates. Then it maps those languages alongside Austin Public Health facilities. The goal is to reveal any areas that might be underserved. The maps are most informative when viewing one language at a time; click the layer button in the top left to toggle language layers on/off.
* [Map 1](https://shalbrook.github.io/language-maps-for-aph/map1.html) (Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, Other Indo-European, Other Asian, Arabic)
* [Map 2](https://shalbrook.github.io/language-maps-for-aph/map2.html) (French-Haitian, Korean, Arabic, Russian, German, Tagalog, Other)

### [Texas Under-18 Population Growth](https://shalbrook.github.io/texas-under-18-pop-growth/)
Use R to analyze recent trends and Texas Demographic Center projections in Texas's growth in that population segment, by county and compared to other counties across the country.

### [Effects of HB 3 on Projected School District Revenue](https://shalbrook.github.io/hb3-school-districts/)
Explore possible relationships between certain school district characteristics and the projected change in per-student M&O revenue under HB 3 as passed by the Texas House in 2019.
