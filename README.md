# Projects

## R Notebooks
In various stages of development as I learn stuff and come up with more ideas. It's more of a playground than a portfolio.

### COVID-19
Because we haven't had enough of this.

- **[COVID-19 Economic Vulnerability](https://shalbrook.github.io/covid-19-economic-vulnerability/).** Map of Chmura's COVID-19 economic vulnerability index for Texas counties.

- **[COVID-19 Test Analysis](https://shalbrook.github.io/covid-19-test-analysis/).** Various analysis and visualizations of COVID-19 test data retrieved via the Covid Tracking Project's API.

### Demographics
- **[ACS Diversity](https://shalbrook.github.io/acs-diversity/).** Calculate and rank diversity of MSAs, counties, and congressional districts using the ACS API, tidycensus, and the Simpson Diversity Index (or HHI).

- **[Median Income with IPUMS](https://shalbrook.github.io/median-income-with-ipums/).** Use IPUMS-USA microdata to calculate weighted median incomes for certain geographic areas.

- **[Language Maps for Austin Public Health](https://shalbrook.github.io/language-maps-for-aph/).** Get language data by census tract for Travis County, Texas, using 2013-2017 5-year ACS estimates, then map those languages alongside Austin Public Health facilities. The goal is to reveal any areas that might be underserved. The maps are easiest to read when viewing one language at a time; use the layer button in the top left to toggle language layers on/off. The dots' colors represent the type of APH facility.
  - [Map 1](https://shalbrook.github.io/language-maps-for-aph/map1.html) (Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, Other Indo-European, Other Asian, Arabic)
  - [Map 2](https://shalbrook.github.io/language-maps-for-aph/map2.html) (French-Haitian, Korean, Arabic, Russian, German, Tagalog, Other)

- **[Texas Under-18 Population Growth](https://shalbrook.github.io/texas-under-18-pop-growth/).** Analyze recent trends (via ACS) and Texas Demographic Center projections in Texas's under-18 population growth, by county and compared to other counties across the country.

### School Finance
- **[Effects of HB 3 on Projected School District Revenue](https://shalbrook.github.io/hb3-school-districts/).** Explore possible relationships between certain school district characteristics and projected changes in per-student M&O revenue under HB 3 as passed by the Texas House in 2019. This notebook also includes a [Leaflet chloropleth map](https://shalbrook.github.io/hb3-school-districts/map_recapdiff_ada.html) showing changes in recapture per student among school districts.

### Tidy Tuesday
Frivolous fun, for learning purposes.
- **[Eurovision](https://shalbrook.github.io/tt-eurovision/).**
