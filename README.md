## R Notebooks
All these notebooks are still under active development as I learn stuff and come up with more ideas. It's more of a playground than a portfolio.

### [ACS Diversity](https://shalbrook.github.io/acs-diversity/)
Calculate and rank diversity of MSAs, counties, and congressional districts using the ACS API, tidycensus, and the Simpson Diversity Index (or HHI).

### [Language Maps for Austin Public Health](https://shalbrook.github.io/language-maps-for-aph/)
Get language data by census tract for Travis County, Texas, using 2013-2017 5-year ACS estimates, then map those languages alongside Austin Public Health facilities. The goal is to reveal any areas that might be underserved. The maps are easiest to read when viewing one language at a time; use the layer button in the top left to toggle language layers on/off. The dots' colors represent the type of APH facility.
* [Map 1](https://shalbrook.github.io/language-maps-for-aph/map1.html) (Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, Other Indo-European, Other Asian, Arabic)
* [Map 2](https://shalbrook.github.io/language-maps-for-aph/map2.html) (French-Haitian, Korean, Arabic, Russian, German, Tagalog, Other)

### [Texas Under-18 Population Growth](https://shalbrook.github.io/texas-under-18-pop-growth/)
Analyze recent trends (via ACS) and Texas Demographic Center projections in Texas's under-18 population growth, by county and compared to other counties across the country.

### [Effects of HB 3 on Projected School District Revenue](https://shalbrook.github.io/hb3-school-districts/)
Explore possible relationships between certain school district characteristics and projected changes in per-student M&O revenue under HB 3 as passed by the Texas House in 2019. This notebook also includes a [Leaflet chloropleth map](https://shalbrook.github.io/hb3-school-districts/map_recapdiff_ada.html) showing changes in recapture per student among school districts.
